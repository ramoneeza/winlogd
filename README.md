## Acknowledgments and Notes

* Original winlogd was a windows service written on c++ ten years ago.  
Microsoft changed EventLog Access Permissions (starting with Windows Vista) 
So, a new program becomes necessary to achieve same results. 
* Other free software available have a GUI.  
With the wide availability of Windows Server CORE / NANO where no GUI is available, a simpler solution is necessary. 
* Porting to .NET Core is not possible, (as far I know) Security permission to audit Event Logs are not available in.NET CORE 3.0
